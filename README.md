Most work so far has been in cleaning up the reference implementation as well as some bug fixes and improvements, including:

- Update Twitter display name every login
- Twitter login is optional (anonymous accounts)
- Server works under 'strict mode'
- Removed some dependencies and better organized code
- Optimized and cleaned up game logic
- New chat commands
- HTTP now works and doesn't 404 users
- Much better logging
